# pinotes-browser-ext
The extension adds a sidebar to your Firefox to take notes easily. It uses [pinotes](https://github.com/quaintdev/pinotes) as a backend. You can start adding notes from your sidebar once you have configured the server address [here](https://github.com/quaintdev/pinotes-browser-ext/blob/2cc96bf99059a34cfe9bd0233dc7b3b7ab96137f/sidebar/panel.js#L1).  

## Important

- **Opening note**: Type the note file name that you want to open and click the open icon to load the note in sidebar.  
- **Saving note**: The first line of the note should be file name. Clicking the save button will then send the file to [pinotes](https://github.com/quaintdev/pinotes). When I saved the note shown in screenshot below, I added "solar" on the first line and then hit the save button to create solar.md on remote server.
